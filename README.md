# Responsive-Portfolio
This is a redesigned version of my-portfolio using bootstrap and media queries to make it mobile resposive


I completely changed the structure of the code in this homework assigment due to the fact that I used the bootstrap grid system.
For the sizing, i used the preset xl, lg, md, and, sm sizes. I also had to use some media queries for the stuff that could not be
attached to the grid system.

In this this version of the assignment I realined some of the divs more easly with the grid, and making it more mobile responsive.
